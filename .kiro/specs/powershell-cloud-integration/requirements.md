# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CloudScope currently provides PowerShell modules for compliance monitoring in Microsoft environments, but the setup process relies on Docker dependencies and has a complex configuration workflow. This feature aims to enhance the PowerShell implementation to eliminate Docker dependencies, simplify the setup process, and leverage existing Microsoft authentication mechanisms for a more streamlined experience. Additionally, we'll ensure the implementation is compatible with LLM (Large Language Model) integration for AI-assisted compliance monitoring and remediation. The enhancement will also include FinOps goals for cost optimization and visual analysis capabilities for generated data without requiring third-party tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Microsoft cloud administrator, I want to deploy CloudScope without Docker dependencies, so that I can quickly implement compliance monitoring in environments where Docker is not available or permitted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing CloudScope PowerShell modules THEN the system SHALL NOT require Docker to be installed
2. WHEN setting up CloudScope THEN all dependencies SHALL be standard PowerShell modules available from PowerShell Gallery
3. WHEN deploying CloudScope THEN the system SHALL work on Windows, macOS, and Linux with PowerShell 7+
4. WHEN installing CloudScope THEN the setup process SHALL provide clear error messages for any missing prerequisites

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Microsoft 365 administrator, I want CloudScope to use existing authentication mechanisms, so that I don't need to configure separate credentials for compliance monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Microsoft services THEN CloudScope SHALL leverage existing Microsoft authentication tokens
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN CloudScope SHALL support modern authentication methods including MFA
3. WHEN running in automated environments THEN CloudScope SHALL support service principal and managed identity authentication
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and remediation steps
5. WHEN connecting to Microsoft Graph THEN CloudScope SHALL use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want a simplified setup process for CloudScope, so that I can quickly start monitoring compliance without extensive configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing CloudScope THEN the setup process SHALL require minimal manual steps
2. WHEN configuring CloudScope THEN the system SHALL provide interactive prompts with sensible defaults
3. WHEN setting up CloudScope THEN the system SHALL automatically detect Microsoft 365 tenant information when possible
4. WHEN initializing CloudScope THEN the system SHALL validate permissions and provide guidance for missing permissions
5. WHEN completing setup THEN the system SHALL provide a quick-start guide for common compliance tasks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want CloudScope to integrate with LLMs for compliance analysis, so that I can leverage AI to identify and remediate compliance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN the system SHALL format data in a way that's compatible with LLM processing
2. WHEN detecting compliance issues THEN the system SHALL provide context that can be used by LLMs for remediation suggestions
3. WHEN exporting compliance data THEN the system SHALL support formats that facilitate LLM integration
4. WHEN documenting compliance findings THEN the system SHALL use structured formats that LLMs can parse effectively
5. WHEN providing remediation steps THEN the system SHALL include machine-readable instructions that LLMs can process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an IT administrator, I want CloudScope to provide comprehensive compliance monitoring for Microsoft cloud services, so that I can ensure my organization meets regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning Microsoft 365 THEN CloudScope SHALL detect compliance issues across Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Teams, and OneDrive
2. WHEN monitoring Azure resources THEN CloudScope SHALL validate compliance with industry standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC2)
3. WHEN analyzing Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) THEN CloudScope SHALL identify security and compliance gaps
4. WHEN evaluating Microsoft Purview (compliance) settings THEN CloudScope SHALL provide recommendations for improvement
5. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN CloudScope SHALL include actionable remediation steps
### Re
quirement 6

**User Story:** As a cloud cost manager, I want CloudScope to include FinOps capabilities, so that I can optimize cloud spending while maintaining compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing cloud resources THEN CloudScope SHALL identify cost optimization opportunities without compromising compliance
2. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN the system SHALL include cost impact analysis for remediation recommendations
3. WHEN monitoring cloud services THEN CloudScope SHALL track resource utilization and highlight inefficiencies
4. WHEN recommending compliance improvements THEN the system SHALL prioritize cost-effective solutions
5. WHEN evaluating compliance controls THEN CloudScope SHALL consider both security impact and cost implications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance analyst, I want visual representations of compliance data, so that I can quickly understand and communicate compliance status without relying on third-party tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN CloudScope SHALL create interactive visualizations using native PowerShell capabilities
2. WHEN analyzing CSV or JSON output files THEN the system SHALL provide built-in visualization commands without external dependencies
3. WHEN presenting compliance findings THEN CloudScope SHALL generate clickable mindmaps for exploring relationships between findings
4. WHEN visualizing compliance data THEN the system SHALL support exporting to common formats (HTML, SVG, PNG)
5. WHEN creating visualizations THEN CloudScope SHALL ensure they work across platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
