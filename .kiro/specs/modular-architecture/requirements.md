# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CloudScope currently has tight coupling between its core functionality and several dependencies including Memgraph database, Docker containers, and other third-party components. This creates technical debt and maintenance challenges as these dependencies age and potentially become vulnerable. This feature aims to decouple these dependencies, creating a more modular architecture that allows components to be replaced or upgraded independently without affecting the core functionality of the system. Additionally, the system should support inventory collection in CSV format to enable easier analysis by Large Language Models (LLMs) and integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The implementation will follow lean stack principles and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to ensure high quality, maintainable code with minimal waste.

## Requirements

### Requirement 0 - Progressive Enhancement Strategy

**User Story:** As a development team, we want to implement CloudScope's modular architecture progressively, so that we can validate each component before adding complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Phase 1 - Rules-Based (Week 1-2)**
   - WHEN implementing basic functionality THEN use simple, deterministic logic first
   - WHEN collecting inventory THEN start with basic file-based storage
   - WHEN implementing security checks THEN begin with hardcoded rules
2. **Phase 2 - Enhanced Heuristics (Week 3-4)**
   - WHEN rules prove insufficient THEN add intelligent patterns based on usage
   - WHEN performance bottlenecks appear THEN implement smart caching
   - WHEN edge cases emerge THEN create adaptive rules
3. **Phase 3 - AI/Advanced Features (Week 5+)**
   - WHEN heuristics reach limits THEN integrate advanced features
   - WHEN implementing AI/LLM features THEN ensure graceful fallbacks
   - WHEN adding complexity THEN maintain simple alternative paths

7. WHEN security rules are deployed THEN they SHALL follow the Observe-Detect-Prevent assertion model
8. WHEN creating security policies THEN use Sigma rules or similar vendor-agnostic formats

### Requirement 5

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN clear boundaries SHALL exist between different functional areas
2. WHEN components communicate THEN they SHALL do so through well-defined interfaces
3. WHEN a component is modified THEN changes SHALL be contained within that component
4. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL follow the established architectural patterns
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN components SHALL be deployable independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to collect inventory data in CSV format, so that it can be easily analyzed by Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated with Model Context Protocol (MCP).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory data is collected THEN it SHALL be exportable in CSV format with consistent schema
2. WHEN CSV data is generated THEN it SHALL include all necessary metadata for LLM analysis
