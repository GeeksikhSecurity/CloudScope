# CloudScope Modular Architecture: Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is CloudScope's modular architecture?

CloudScope's modular architecture is a design approach that decouples the core business logic from external dependencies using the hexagonal architecture pattern (ports and adapters). This allows components to be replaced or upgraded independently without affecting the core functionality of the system.

### What are the key benefits of this architecture?

- **Flexibility**: Replace components (like databases) without changing core code
- **Testability**: Easily test components in isolation with mock dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Reduce technical debt through clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Add new functionality through plugins without modifying core code
- **Resilience**: Components can fail independently without bringing down the entire system

### What design patterns does CloudScope use?

- **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters): Separates core business logic from external dependencies
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data storage and retrieval
- **Dependency Injection**: Provides dependencies to components rather than having them create or find dependencies
- **Plugin System**: Allows extending functionality without modifying core code
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when external systems fail

## Getting Started

### How do I set up CloudScope without Docker?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cloudscope.git
cd cloudscope

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize configuration
python -m cloudscope init --config-dir=./config

# Run with file-based storage
python -m cloudscope run --storage=file
```

### How do I configure CloudScope to use my existing database?

Edit your configuration file (`config/cloudscope-config.json`) to specify your database connection:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "adapter": "sqlite",  // or "memgraph", "postgresql", etc.
    "config": {
      "path": "./cloudscope.db"  // or connection string for other databases
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use environment variables:

```bash
export CLOUDSCOPE_DB_ADAPTER=postgresql
export CLOUDSCOPE_DB_URI=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/cloudscope
python -m cloudscope run
```

### How do I create a custom collector?

1. Create a new Python file in the `plugins` directory
2. Implement the `Collector` interface
3. Register your collector as a plugin

See the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart_guide.md#4-using-the-plugin-system) for a complete example.

## Architecture Questions

### How does CloudScope decouple from database dependencies?

CloudScope uses the repository pattern to abstract data storage and retrieval. The core business logic interacts with repository interfaces (ports) rather than concrete implementations. This allows you to swap out database implementations without changing the core code.

Example:

```python
# Core business logic uses the interface
def process_assets(repository: AssetRepository):
    assets = repository.find({"asset_type": "server"})
    for asset in assets:
        # Process assets...
        pass

# Different implementations can be provided
file_repo = FileBasedAssetRepository("./data")
process_assets(file_repo)

sqlite_repo = SQLiteAssetRepository("./cloudscope.db")
process_assets(sqlite_repo)
```

### How does the plugin system work?

The plugin system uses Python's dynamic module loading capabilities to discover and load plugins at runtime. Plugins implement specific interfaces (like `CollectorPlugin` or `ExporterPlugin`) and are registered with the plugin manager.

The plugin manager handles:
- Discovery of plugins in designated directories
- Validation of plugin interfaces and dependencies
- Loading and initialization of plugins
- Providing plugins to the application when needed

### How does CloudScope handle errors and failures?

CloudScope implements several resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when external systems fail
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with reduced functionality when components fail
3. **Retry with Backoff**: Automatically retries failed operations with exponential backoff
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides alternative implementations when preferred ones fail

## Development Questions

### How do I follow the TDD approach with CloudScope?

1. Write a test for the feature you want to implement
2. Run the test to verify it fails (Red)
3. Implement the feature
4. Run the test to verify it passes (Green)
5. Refactor the code while keeping tests passing

Use Kiro to enforce this workflow:

```bash
# Create a new feature using Kiro workflow
kiro workflow run modular-architecture-workflow \
  --params feature_name=asset_tagging \
  module_name=asset_tagger \
  module_path=domain/services
```

### How do I add a new domain model?

Create a new Python file in the `cloudscope/domain/models` directory and define your model class. See the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart_guide.md#2-adding-a-new-domain-model) for an example.

### How do I implement a new repository?

1. Define the repository interface in `cloudscope/ports/repositories`
2. Implement the interface in `cloudscope/adapters/repositories`
3. Register the implementation with the dependency injection container

See the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart_guide.md#3-implementing-a-repository) for an example.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why aren't my plugins loading?

Common issues include:

1. **Incorrect Plugin Structure**: Ensure your plugin implements the correct interface
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Check that all required dependencies are installed
3. **Permission Issues**: Verify file permissions on plugin files
4. **Import Errors**: Check for import errors in plugin code

Enable debug logging for more information:

```bash
export CLOUDSCOPE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python -m cloudscope run --verbose
```

### How do I fix database connection issues?

1. **Check Configuration**: Verify database configuration in config file or environment variables
2. **Test Connectivity**: Use database-specific tools to test connectivity
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the application has necessary permissions
4. **Use Fallback Storage**: Configure fallback storage for when primary storage fails

```bash
# Use fallback storage
export CLOUDSCOPE_DB_ADAPTER=file
export CLOUDSCOPE_DB_PATH=./fallback-data
python -m cloudscope run
```

### How do I resolve Kiro rule violations?

1. **Check Rule Description**: Understand what the rule is checking for
2. **Fix the Issue**: Make the necessary changes to comply with the rule
3. **Run Specific Rule Check**: Verify your fix resolves the issue

```bash
# Check specific rule
kiro safeguard check --rule hexagonal-architecture

# Fix common issues automatically
kiro fix docstrings
```

## Performance Questions

### How do I optimize CloudScope for large datasets?

1. **Use Batch Operations**: Process data in batches rather than individually
2. **Implement Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
3. **Use Streaming**: Stream large datasets rather than loading them into memory
4. **Configure Database Indexes**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields

```python
# Example batch processing
def process_assets_in_batches(repository: AssetRepository, batch_size: int = 1000):
    offset = 0
    while True:
        assets = repository.find({}, limit=batch_size, offset=offset)
        if not assets:
            break
        
        # Process batch
        for asset in assets:
            # Process asset...
            pass
        
        offset += batch_size
```

### How do I monitor CloudScope's performance?

1. **Enable Metrics Collection**: Configure metrics collection in your configuration
2. **Use OpenTelemetry**: Set up distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
3. **Configure Logging**: Enable performance logging for critical operations
4. **Set Up Dashboards**: Create dashboards for visualizing performance metrics

```bash
# Enable performance monitoring
export CLOUDSCOPE_METRICS_ENABLED=true
export CLOUDSCOPE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317
python -m cloudscope run
```

## Compliance Questions

### How does CloudScope handle sensitive data?

CloudScope implements several mechanisms for handling sensitive data:

1. **Data Classification**: Annotate sensitive data with classification decorators
2. **Encryption**: Automatically encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
3. **Access Control**: Enforce access control for sensitive operations
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all access to sensitive data

```python
# Example data classification
from cloudscope.compliance import data_classification

class User:
    @data_classification("personal")
    def __init__(self, user_id: str, name: str, email: str):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.name = name  # Personal data
        self.email = email  # Personal data
```

### How do I ensure CloudScope complies with GDPR?

1. **Use Data Classification**: Annotate personal data with `@data_classification("personal")`
2. **Implement Data Subject Rights**: Add methods for data export, deletion, etc.
3. **Configure Data Retention**: Set up data retention policies
4. **Enable Audit Logging**: Log all access to personal data

Use Kiro to verify compliance:

```bash
# Verify GDPR compliance
kiro verify compliance --framework GDPR
```
